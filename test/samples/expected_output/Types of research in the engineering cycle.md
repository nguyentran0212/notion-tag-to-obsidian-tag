1. Evaluation research [[Criteria of Evaluation Research ]] 
    1. Problem investigation (which problems exist in RE practice?)
    2. Implementation evaluation (what are the experiences with this implemented solutions?)
2. Validation research [[Criteria of validation research]] 
    1. Solution validation (what are the properties of a proposed solution?)
3. Proposal of a solution [[Solution Design in Research]] [[Criteria of proposal of solution papers]] 
4. Others
    1. Philosophical papers [[Philosophical papers in research]] 
    2. Opinion papers
    3. Experience papers [[Experience report paper]] [[Criteria of personal experience papers]] [[Guidelines for experience papers]] 

> The difference between validation research and evaluation research is that in the first, techniques not yet implemented in practice are investigated, whereas in the second, techniques-in-practice are investigated. As with all research, hypotheses (expected outcomes) may be falsified. Techniques may not work as expected, and both kinds of research, validation, and evaluation, can send the researcher back to the drawing board to improve the technique

> One would not expect field research to be a useful research method in validation research.
